abstract = {Nowadays, software systems are mainly Web front-based, Cloud-deployed and accessible by a wide audience over the Internet. These online systems commonly rely on Service-oriented Architecture principles, where they are built as orchestrations of RESTful (and in some rare cases as SOAP-based) services. Integrating new services in an existing orchestration is a challenging and risky task because trustworthiness of these services is not guaranteed throughout their lifetime. Reputation of services is a good indicator about the overall quality of services, because it reflects consumer satisfaction regarding the service-offered functionality and quality. Thus, reputation of services could be considered in the selection and recommendation of trustworthy services. In this paper, we present a framework for the management of web service reputation to conduct a better service recommendation. We present a reputation assessment model that aggregates fair user feedback ratings. The model includes a mechanism that prevents the introduction of malicious feedback ratings, by penalizing detected specious users. In addition, this framework includes a bootstrapping technique for estimating reputation of newcomer services based on neighbor similarity and initial advertised QoS. A set of experiments has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results of these experiments highlighted the potential of our framework. These are presented at the end of the paper.}
